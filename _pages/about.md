I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Salerno under the supervision of prof. Biagio Cosenza. I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a specialization on Security from the University of Salerno in 2022. During my thesis work I contributed to the EuroHPC project  <a href='#'>LiGate</a> by porting and optimizing LiGen, a framework for drug discovery. This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in performance portability and HPC optimization. Currently, my research focuses performance portability, programming models and optimization techniques for energy-efficient and approximate computing in modern HPC systems.
